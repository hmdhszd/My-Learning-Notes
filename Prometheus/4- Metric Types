METRIC TYPES



-----------------------------------






Counter   ->    only increase  (can be reset to zero)

A counter is a cumulative metric that represents a single monotonically increasing counter whose value can only increase or be reset to zero on restart. 



-----------------------------------






Gauge   ->    can increase or decrease

A gauge is a metric that represents a single numerical value that can arbitrarily go up and down.



-----------------------------------






Histogram   ->    sum and count of metricsit counts the number os events
					sum of observed values
					total counts of events

A histogram samples observations (usually things like request durations or response sizes) and counts them in configurable buckets. It also provides a sum of all observed values.



-----------------------------------





Summary   ->    sum and count of metrics

Similar to a histogram, a summary samples observations (usually things like request durations and response sizes). While it also provides a total count of observations and a sum of all observed values, it calculates configurable quantiles over a sliding time window.
