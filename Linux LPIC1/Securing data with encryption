ssh key pairs


all known host ssh keys will be saved here:

â–¶ cat ~/.ssh/known_hosts

Login with key pairs instead of password:






1) First of all, we should generate our public/private in our system:



Generating public/private rsa key pair.


hamid# ssh-keygen 



hamid# ls  ~/.ssh/  | grep rsa
id_rsa
id_rsa.pub






2) Login to server with "copy-ssh-command":

hamid# ssh-copy-id 192.168.118.137



with this command, we will copy out public key in targer server:

we can see them here:       [root@localhost ~]# cat  ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

encryption using gpg






A software called gpg lets us use public and private keys to encrypt our data. At the beginning we have to create a key pair:

hamid# gpg --gen-key








Then we need to share our public key to other people. To export our public key file we need to run:

hamid# gpg --export name > gpg.pub







and the other party can import our public key into his gpg database by:

hamid# gpg --import gpg.pub









At this stage, if he wants to encrypt some data to us (say the file file.txt) he should run:

hamid# gpg --out file.txt.encrypted --recipient hamidhszd@gmail.com --encrypt file.txt







and give the file.txt.encrypted to us. For openning it, we just need to:

hamid# gpg --out out.txt --decrypt file.txt.encrypted



and Done!

revoking keys



if we lost our key, we revoke it:


hamid# gpg --output revoke.asc --gen-revoke hamidhszd@gmail.com

signing


By encrypting a document using your private key, you let everyone to try to open it using your public key and if they succeed, they will be sure that you have signed it using YOUR private key!




hamid# gpg --clearsign originalfile










and another one to verify that a document is singed correctly:

hamid# gpg --verify recievedfile
