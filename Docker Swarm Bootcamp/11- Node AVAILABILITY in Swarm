The AVAILABILITY column shows whether or not the scheduler can assign tasks to the node:

Active:
	means that the scheduler can assign tasks to the node.

Pause:
	means the scheduler doesn’t assign new tasks to the node, but existing tasks remain running.

Drain:
	means the scheduler doesn’t assign new tasks to the node. The scheduler shuts down any existing tasks and schedules them on an available node.






$ docker node update --availability drain node-1
