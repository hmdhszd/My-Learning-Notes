MBR    limited   2TB


Primary, Extended & Logical Partitions
The partition table is located in the master boot record (MBR) of a disk. The MBR is the first sector on the disk, so the partition table is not a very large part of it. This limits the primary partitions to 4 and the max size of a disk to around 2TBs. If you need more partitions you have a define one extended and then create logicals inside them.

Linux numbers the primary partitions 1, 2, 3 & 4. If you define an extended partitions, logical partitions inside it will be called 5, 6, 7.



So:

/dev/sda3 is the 3rd primary partition on the first disk
/dev/sdb5 is the first logical partition on the second disk
/dev/sda7 is the 3rd logical partition of the first physical disk









The newer GUID Partition Table (or GPT) solves this problems. If you format your disk with GTP you can have 128 primary partitions (no need to extended and logical).

LVM

for resize your partitions or even add new disks and add them to your mount points



LVM helps you create one partition from different disks and add or remove space to them. The main concepts are:

-Physical Volume (pv): a whole drive or a partition. It is better to define partitions and not use whole disks - unpartitioned.

-Volume Groups (vg): this is the collection of one or more pvs. OS will see the vg as one big disk. PVs in one vg, can have different sizes or even be on different physical disks.

-Logical Volumes (lv): OS will see lvs as partitions. You can format an lv wit your OS and use it.
